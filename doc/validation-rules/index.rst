Validation Rules
****************

The specification for validation rules, along with detailed implementation recommendations, will be provided in the next version of the documentation.

For now, please refer to the general principles of :term:`ELCL` validation: validation rules define the expected structure and constraints of a configuration document. They ensure data integrity, verify compliance with the intended schema, and allow for default values to be supplied where needed.

The upcoming specification will detail the syntax, usage guidelines, and best practices to help you implement robust and secure validation support in your projects.
